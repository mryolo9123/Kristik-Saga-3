Let me just say that adding the flowchart was so fucking time consuming. It required adding a persistent variable that would
load before the game started. Afterwards, i had to create the UI (which in itself was frustrating as certain elements like the scrollbar
refused to work but i eventually got it working.) Not only this, but i had to make new _idle and _hover button types for the flowchart.
That took up quite a bit of time. But also the scene jumping feature was pretty annoying. ren'py doesnt have a proper jump feature,
so i have to use the Start() tag and also make sure the window and quick menu is shown, the character(s) in the scene is shown, and
make sure the background is correct as the Start() tag simply just changes the dialogue in the textbox but doesnt actually jump to the
scene (as that would destroy the workflow.)

Overall, this was pretty damn frustrating but also vey rewarding when i got it working. I think im gonna take a nap... my brain hurts...
