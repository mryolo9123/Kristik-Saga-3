# Kristik-Saga-3
A set of visual novels using the renpy scripting engine. Last edit was in 2020. Go ahead, fork it to your desire!

Many assets were created by me, but some (like the sprites) were not made by me and were taken off of opengameart.
I seriously do not remember who/what the original assets were from, but if you find out, edit this!

Several pieces of music was cut from the original, due to it being copyrighted material.

# What's included?
This includes all the assets (sprites, scripts, audio, etc) as well as installer scripts, the installer itself, the demo pre-build, as well as my own personal devlog (which there's only one.)

# What's in the releases?
The release only includes the installer.
